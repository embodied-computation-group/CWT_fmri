# Analyst Log - CWT fMRI Project

## Session Summary: Basic Analysis and Learning Verification
**Date**: 2024-01-06  
**Duration**: Several hours  
**Goal**: Create basic behavioral analysis script and verify learning relative to true experimental design

## Key Challenges Faced

### 1. **Initial Misunderstanding of Experimental Design**
- Started with incorrect assumptions about reversal identification
- Used processed data (`TrialsSinceRev`) instead of true experimental contingencies
- Generated misleading plots showing "odd" non-reversals and non-opposing cues

### 2. **Complex MATLAB Log Structure**
- Struggled to correctly identify the true experimental design within MATLAB `.mat` files
- Initially misinterpreted variables (`vars[[28]]`, `vars[[29]]`) as true contingencies
- User provided key MATLAB code snippets and explicit clarifications about opposing cues

### 3. **Iterative Debugging Process**
- Created multiple temporary scripts to understand MATLAB file structure
- User provided `summarize_subject` MATLAB analysis file as reference
- Eventually identified `vars[[18]]` as the correct design matrix (`cueProbabilityOutput`)

## What We Accomplished

### ✅ **True Experimental Design Understanding**
- **Opposing Cues**: Within each block, cues sum to 1.0 (e.g., 0.82/0.18)
- **Three Probability Levels**: 0.18/0.82, 0.5/0.5, 0.82/0.18
- **Block Structure**: 11 blocks with clear transitions between predictive and non-predictive
- **Reversals**: When desired_prob changes (e.g., from 0.82/0.18 to 0.18/0.82)

### ✅ **Correct Contingency Plots**
- Created `plot_true_contingencies_correct.R` that extracts true design from `vars[[18]]`
- Generated 199 true contingency plots showing correct opposing cue design
- Plots now show proper reversals and opposing contingencies

### ✅ **Repository Cleanup**
- Removed 12 incorrect debugging scripts
- Removed 203 incorrect figures based on wrong data sources
- Organized MATLAB task code in `/code/task/` directory
- Updated documentation with complete experimental design details

### ✅ **Split Analysis Scripts**
- **`01_basic_task_effects.R`**: Focused perceptual decision-making analysis
  - Key IVs: Stimulus Noise, Trial Validity, Cue Type
  - Key DVs: Accuracy, Response Time, Confidence
  - Generated 5 focused plots with proper statistical visualization
- **`02_learning_relative_to_design.R`**: Learning analysis relative to true design
  - Attempted to use MATLAB logs for true contingencies
  - Fallback to simplified analysis using available data
  - Generated 2 learning plots

## Current State

### **Working Components**
- ✅ True contingency plots showing correct experimental design
- ✅ Basic task effects analysis with proper IVs/DVs
- ✅ Clean repository structure
- ✅ Complete documentation of experimental design

### **Issues Remaining**
- ❌ Learning analysis not fully convincing
- ❌ MATLAB log integration incomplete (0 files found)
- ❌ Learning plots relative to true design need improvement
- ❌ Core scientific question (learning around reversals) not fully addressed

## Key Files Created/Modified

### **Scripts**
- `code/analysis/01_basic_task_effects.R` - Basic perceptual decision-making analysis
- `code/analysis/02_learning_relative_to_design.R` - Learning analysis (needs work)
- `code/analysis/plot_true_contingencies_correct.R` - True contingency plots

### **Documentation**
- `docs/task_details.md` - Complete experimental design documentation
- `docs/comprehensive_basic_analysis_summary.md` - Analysis summary

### **Figures**
- `results/figures/basic_analysis/` - 5 focused basic analysis plots
- `results/figures/learning_analysis/` - 2 learning plots (needs improvement)
- `results/figures/basic_analysis/true_contingency_plots/` - 199 true contingency plots

### **Tables**
- `results/tables/basic_task_effects_summary.csv` - Comprehensive condition statistics
- `results/tables/learning_simple.csv` - Learning metrics

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### **Priority 1: Fix Learning Analysis**
1. **Debug MATLAB log loading** - Why are 0 files found?
2. **Create proper learning plots** relative to true contingencies
3. **Focus on learning around reversals** - the core scientific question

### **Priority 2: Improve Basic Analysis**
1. **Add statistical tests** (ANOVAs, t-tests)
2. **Create publication-ready figures**
3. **Add effect size calculations**

### **Priority 3: Repository Cleanup**
1. **Remove any remaining temporary files**
2. **Organize scripts by purpose**
3. **Update README with current state**

## Key Insights Gained

1. **True Experimental Design**: Opposing cues with three probability levels (0.18, 0.5, 0.82)
2. **MATLAB Log Structure**: `vars[[18]]` contains the complete design matrix
3. **Learning Analysis**: Need to plot subject performance relative to true contingencies
4. **Repository Management**: Important to clean up temporary files as we go

## User Feedback Throughout Session
- "what I find odd is, for example for subject 225 it looks like the fourth 'reversal' marks a change from around 80 to around 82 - that is not actually a reversal"
- "I am also quite mystified how you can infer the design from the info you have for each subject without their full logs"
- "its still wrong. still showing the wrong thing"
- "within a block, cue A will predict happy with a given probability, and cue b will predict happy with the inverse probability"
- "I am a bit dissatisfied. but its late, so sleepy time"

## Technical Notes
- Used `R.matlab` package to read MATLAB `.mat` files
- Created custom Nature Neuroscience theme for plots
- Implemented proper error handling for file loading
- Used `tidyverse` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualization
